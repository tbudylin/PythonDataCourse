To specify table dependencies in the table `definition` using the `->` symbol. In the **my_database.py** file, there is an example of a table dependency. The schema in this file is called `homework2` and we have a total of three tables: `FlySubject`, `RecordingSession`, `Stimulus`.\n",

This means that the primary keys of the `FlySubject` and `Stimulus` tables are inherited by `RecordingSession`. However, they are inherited in two different ways. In the case of the `FlySubject` table, the primary keys of `FlySubject` become part of the primary keys of `RecordingSession`. In the case of the `Stimulus` table, the primary keys of `Stimulus` are dependent attributes in the `RecordingSession` table. Since `RecordingSession` inherits `FlySubject` and `Stimulus`, it is necessary to have this class below the other two in the python file.\n",
